# ─── headless User-Agent de-Headless'ing ─────────────────────────────────
#
# New-headless Chrome (132+, which Patchright launches via bare `--headless`)
# stamps the `HeadlessChrome/<v>` token into the User-Agent STRING — on every
# JS thread (main page AND Web/SharedWorkers) and in the `User-Agent` request
# header. It is a dead-giveaway automation tell, and since 0.6.4 every
# agent-facing path (MCP, `go`-first auto-spawn, non-TTY CLI) defaults
# headless, so this rode every fan-out. Patchright does NOT touch it (verified
# in its driver source: no Headless-stripping anywhere) and it filters
# `add_init_script`, so the JS-injection school can't fix it either.
#
# IMPORTANT — what does NOT leak: the Sec-CH-UA client hints. New-headless
# already reports `Google Chrome`/`Chromium` in `userAgentData.brands`, the
# high-entropy `fullVersionList`, and the Sec-CH-UA header at baseline. So
# this is a UA-STRING-only problem; we must NOT touch client hints.
#
# Mechanism — a browser-wide `--user-agent=<clean>` launch flag, NOT a
# Playwright `user_agent` context option. Patchright applies the context
# option via per-context `Network.setUserAgentOverride`, which is target-
# scoped and so CANNOT reach a SharedWorker (a separate target) — measured:
# the context option leaves the SharedWorker UA saying `HeadlessChrome`, a
# main-vs-worker MISMATCH that is a STRONGER tell than the original uniform
# leak. The `--user-agent` flag sets the browser's actual UA, so it covers
# every target including SharedWorkers, and it lands at the launch layer —
# outside Patchright's CDP-message patching, so no interference. Patchright
# passes custom `args` through unfiltered (`chromeArguments.push(...args)`).
# We strip ONLY the Headless marker; OS/platform/version tokens are preserved
# verbatim (not OS spoofing).
#
# We probe the real Chrome's UA once per daemon lifetime (so the string
# reflects the ACTUAL installed version — no staleness tell) and cache it
# in-process. The lock keeps a cold-start fan-out from racing N probes.

    (which can exhaust file descriptors on long-running daemons with frequent

    `proxy`: optional Playwright proxy config dict

    `timezone_id` (0.6.11): coherence override, typically set to match a proxy's

    NOT overridden — see geo.py: it can't reach workers without a mismatch.)

    `gpu` (0.13.0): headless GPU WebGL. When True AND headless, injects the ANGLE
    launch flags (see gpu.py) so WebGL's UNMASKED_RENDERER reports the box's real GPU
    instead of SwiftShader — no Xvfb, no headed window. No-op when headed/attach (they

    `gpu_node` (0.13.0 de-twinning): pin the GPU session to a specific render node
    (e.g. "nvidia") by setting the glvnd EGL vendor env, so different same-box accounts

    # chrome.runtime can use `--backend nodriver` (which doesn't filter)
    # or attach mode (real user Chrome).
